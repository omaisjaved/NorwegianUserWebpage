  /*Definition and Usage
    The extends keyword extends a class (indicates that a class is inherited from another class).

    In Java, it is possible to inherit attributes and methods from one class to another.
    We group the "inheritance concept" into two categories:

    subclass (child) - the class that inherits from another class
    superclass (parent) - the class being inherited from
            To inherit from a class, use the extends keyword.*/

public class LoginPage extends Main {

        //goToHomePage is a method

    /*The purpose of the interrupt system is to provide a well-defined framework for allowing threads
    to interrupt tasks (potentially time-consuming ones) in other threads.
    A good way to think about interruption is that it doesnâ€™t actually interrupt a running thread
    it just requests that the thread interrupt itself at the next convenient opportunity. */
